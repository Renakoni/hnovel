# Android checks

Pull requests, merge groups, and manual runs use four independent workflows:

| Workflow | Checks | Reports |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `unit-tests.yml` (1/4) | `JVM unit tests` | `unit-test-reports` |
| `device-tests.yml` (2/4) | `Isolated execution (API 24)` and `Isolated execution (API 35)` | `execution-platform-api-24`, `execution-platform-api-35` |
| `release-checks.yml` (3/4) | `Release APK` and `Minified source runtime (API 35)` | `release-build-reports`, `minified-source-runtime` |
| `lint.yml` (4/4) | `Android Lint` | `android-lint-reports` |

The JVM check no longer waits for the release APK build. Device tests retain the
API matrix, test classes, and diagnostic reports. The minified check still builds
the benchmark variant and exercises the source runtime and read-aloud service.
The workflows have separate concurrency groups so they cannot cancel each other.

Require all six check names above in the `main` branch's status checks. In
particular, `Release APK` must be required separately now that it is outside the
JVM job. Keep strict up-to-date checking and the other branch protections enabled.
YAML alone does not update repository protection settings.

## Fixed tools and reusable caches

The repository contains scripts, SDK package metadata, and small AboutLibraries
license texts. Toolchains, Maven dependencies, and system images are not Git
assets. `.github/actions/android-environment` selects Temurin 21.0.8+9 for the
compiler and 22.0.2+9 for Gradle/tests, plus the repository's Gradle wrapper.
`.github/actions/android-sdk` restores only the SDK and optional image needed by
that job. Actions are pinned to commits and runners use `ubuntu-24.04`; GitHub
still updates the hosted OS, so this is not an immutable machine image.

`prepare-android-sdk.sh` names exact upstream ZIP revisions: SDK platform 37.0 r2,
Build Tools 36.0.0, Platform Tools 37.0.1, Emulator 37.1.11 (build 15917651), and
Google APIs x86_64 images API 24 r27 / API 35 r9. A cache miss downloads only the
missing packages with bounded connection times and retries. Installed-package
metadata in `ci-environment/sdk-packages` lets AGP recognize those exact packages
without sdkmanager/avdmanager repository scans. Change URLs, metadata, and cache
keys together when upgrading. Automatic Gradle JDK/SDK provisioning is disabled.

| Cache | Consumers | Contents / writer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gradle (`setup-gradle`) | All build/test checks | Wrapper, dependencies, transforms, local build cache; main writes, PR/merge-group runs read only |
| Variant task outputs | Release and Minified checks | Separate Release/benchmark output directories; restored from the latest same-variant entry and saved after a successful APK build |
| SDK | All checks | Platform, Build Tools, adb; saved immediately after successful preparation |
| Emulator + one API image | Device checks only | API 24 and API 35 have separate exact keys; saved before boot/tests |
| Robolectric SDKs | JVM check only | Runtime jars under `~/.m2/repository/org/robolectric` |

`org.gradle.caching=true` remains enabled. Gradle validates task inputs before
reusing outputs; a restored cache does not skip changed code or guarantee every
task is cacheable. Only setup-gradle owns the Gradle dependency/transform cache:
do not add a second whole-home/wrapper cache or archive every module's `build/`
directory. PR checks read main's reusable entries rather than each writing another
large snapshot. Release and benchmark additionally retain task outputs, including
R8, in separate local caches selected by `ci.init.gradle`. These start with shared
main outputs and preserve each variant's own entries. The minified cache is saved
before device tests so a test failure does not discard successful compilation.
Cache keys include the variant and commit; restore prefixes allow reuse after
source edits, with Gradle checking the actual task inputs. Closed PR cache entries
are removed by `cleanup-pr-caches.yml`, which runs only trusted base workflow code
and deletes only that PR's merge-ref caches without checking out PR code.
Caches are disposable acceleration: misses fall back to normal dependency or
fixed tool downloads. AboutLibraries uses local license texts instead of making
per-library license/funding requests during APK builds.

`gradle-cache.yml` populates main's caches after build/environment configuration
changes or a manual main run. It compiles Debug/test APKs and unit-test sources,
and assembles the benchmark instrumentation APK. It does not run R8, boot a
device, or execute tests. Separate API image jobs only prepare SDK files. This
main population matters because caches written by one PR are not shared with
other PRs. Source edits can still miss older compiled outputs; manually warming
main refreshes them without introducing extra checks on every PR.

## Emulator scope and failure handling

JVM tests, Lint, and Release assembly do not start an emulator. Device tests cover
real Binder/isolated processes, WebView, Android UI, and service behavior that a
host JVM cannot fully validate. API 24 retains minimum-version coverage. The
Minified API 35 check runs only `MinifiedSourceRuntimeTest` and
`ReadAloudSmokeTest` against a shrunk App; it does not repeat the Debug suite.
Both `:app:assembleBenchmark` and `:benchmark:assembleBenchmark` are required:
the former builds the shrunk App, the latter its instrumentation APK. The target
APK configuration is non-transitive because App libraries are already inside
that APK; resolving them again can select unrelated Desktop/JVM variants.

APKs build before boot, avoiding competition between compilation and the device.
`run-static-emulator.sh` creates a fresh 320x640, 160dpi KVM AVD from the fixed
image, with no snapshots or online SDK tools. Boot/ADB readiness has two
180-second polling windows with separately bounded ADB commands. Only a failed
startup gets a second attempt with fresh data; assertions, App crashes, and tests
are never rerun automatically. Missing tools/KVM fail before launch.

`emulator-tests.sh` retains the NexusLauncher ANR readiness check and streams
crash/system/event logcat to `runtime-events.txt` throughout testing. It also
collects final diagnostics without replacing the test exit status. A missing
JUnit/native report alone is not proof of an App crash: correlate these logs
with instrumentation output and the job timeout/cancellation reason. Native
environment reports remain required on API 35.

## Lint and translation coverage

`Android Lint` runs the standard-library resource contract tests/checker and
`:app:lintDebug` with the repository wrapper and JDK 22. No emulator is required.
Lint still runs after a resource-check failure to collect its diagnostics. Bash
pipefail preserves failures while tee records output; neither step allows errors
to become a successful check. HTML/XML/text reports and logs upload with
`if: always()`, including failing runs. Setup failures before analysis may leave
no Lint report; the Actions step log remains the evidence in that case.

| Scope | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| App Debug | Full Android Lint, including main/Debug resources and the configured test source analysis |
| App translations | Default/en, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, generic Russian and existing ru-RU overrides; see [resource contracts](RESOURCE_CONTRACTS.md) |
| `:api` | Dependency model/class information used by app analysis; no independent `:api:lintDebug` scan |
| `:plugin:js` | Separate Android app; not included in this check |
| `:benchmark` | Android test module, exercised by the existing minified device job; not independently linted |
| App Release/snapshot/benchmark | No full variant Lint here; Release assembly/lintVital and minified runtime remain separate checks |
| JVM source/EPUB/compiler modules | Existing JVM/build checks; not independent Android Lint targets |

The gate fails on Error/Fatal diagnostics outside the reviewed baseline. Warnings
remain visible without requiring a mechanical cleanup of all existing warnings.
See [Lint triage](LINT.md) for exact deferred locations and removal conditions.
Do not regenerate a baseline automatically in CI, globally disable i18n/API/back
checks, or add a known crash/data-loss defect to it. `LintBaselineFixed` is an
Error in full Lint: when a deferred finding is fixed, remove its obsolete entry.
It is not Fatal because lintVital does not run every detector in the baseline.

The Lint concurrency key includes the event and PR/ref, keeping PR, merge-group,
and manual runs independent from one another and from the other three workflows.
Configure `Android Lint` as required only after a real PR has passed; read back
the protection settings and retain the existing five checks and strict mode.

## Maintenance

After workflow changes, run `actionlint`, the script regression tests, and the
affected Gradle input/task resolution. Exercise both cache hits and misses,
including failed downloads, interrupted boot, and preserved test failures. Generated
test reports belong in Actions artifacts or local build directories, not in Git.
